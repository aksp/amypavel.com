I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of [Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences][eecs] at the [University of California, Berkeley][berkeley] and a Visiting Faculty Resesarcher at [Google Research][googleresearch]. Before joining UC Berkeley, I spent three wonderful years (Spring 2022-Spring 2025) as an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Computer Science][utcs] at the [University of Texas at Austin][utaustin].  

I was previously a postdoc at [Carnegie Mellon University][cmu], a Research Scientist at [Apple][apple], and I received my PhD from [UC Berkeley EECS][eecs]. I regularly teach a Computer Science class that covers the design and development of user interfaces (Introduction to Human-Computer Interaction). Prior versions include [CS160 at UC Berkeley in 2018][coursewebsite] and [CS378 at UT Austin in 2022][coursewebsiteut].
