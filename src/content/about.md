I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at The University of Texas at Austin. Before I joined UT in 2022, I was a postdoc at [Carnegie Mellon University][cmu] (supervised by [Jeff Bigham][jeff]) and a Research Scientist at [Apple][apple]. I received my PhD from the department of [Electrical Engineering and Computer Science][eecs] at [UC Berkeley][berkeley], advised by professors [Bj√∂rn Hartmann][bjoern] at UC Berkeley and [Maneesh Agrawala][maneesh] at Stanford. 

I regularly teach a Computer Science class covers the design and development of user interfaces (Introduction to Human-Computer Interaction). Prior versions of this class include [CS160 at UC Berkeley in Summer 2018][coursewebsite] and [CS378 at UT Austin in Spring 2022][coursewebsiteut].
