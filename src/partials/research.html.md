My dissertation research focuses on developing new algorithms and interfaces for searching, browsing and skimming videos. My projects include new text-based interfaces for exploring educational lecture videos, films, and video critiques. In addition, I've worked to understand how people view and interact with 360° videos. Though I've used video as a medium, I'm broadly interested in how to support users in benefiting from imperfect computational results in domains such as search, collaboration, and content generation.

<!-- Through working with video as a medium, I'm broadly interested in how we can use imperfect computational results to support information seeking for the purposes of research (e.g., finding clips in film or lectures), collaboration (e.g., feedback and revision), and content creation (e.g., reorienting shots in 360° videos). -->

As an undergraduate, I worked on a system for searching and browsing photoshop tutorials, and tools for helping crowdworkers provide useful design critiques.
