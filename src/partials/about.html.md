I am a postdoctoral researcher at Carnegie Mellon University and Apple, working with [Jeff Bigham][jeff].

I recently graduated with my PhD from the department of [Electrical Engineering and Computer Science][eecs] at [UC Berkeley][berkeley]. I was advised by professors [Bj√∂rn Hartmann][bjoern] at UC Berkeley and [Maneesh Agrawala][maneesh] at Stanford, and my doctoral work was supported by an [NDSEG fellowship][NDSEG]. I've previously been supported by a department EECS Excellence Award and a Sandisk Gold Fellowship. 

In the summer of 2018, I served as the lecturer for [CS160][cs160], the UC Berkeley user interface design and development course.
