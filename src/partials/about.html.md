I am a fifth-year PhD student in the department of [Electrical Engineering and Computer Science][eecs] at [UC Berkeley][berkeley]. I am advised by professors [Bj√∂rn Hartmann][bjoern] at UC Berkeley and [Maneesh Agrawala][maneesh] at Stanford, and my work is supported by an [NDSEG fellowship][NDSEG]. In the past, I've been supported by a department EECS Excellence Award, and a Sandisk Gold Fellowship.

This summer, I will be serving as the lecturer for [CS160][cs160], our user interface design and development course!
