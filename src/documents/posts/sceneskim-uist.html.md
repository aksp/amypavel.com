## What is SceneSkim? 
SceneSkim lets users search and browse in movies using text, making it easy to locate clips within movies.

## Motivation  
Searching for clips in film is an important task for film studies researchers, film professionals and media editors who analyze, share and remix video clips. But, searching and browsing within movies is a time-consuming task. 

Consider a user who wishes to analyze the context and appearance of lightsabers, in the Star Wars movie series. If she knows the films already, she might try to navigate to remembered scenes using DVD chapter menus, or by scrubbing through video timelines. Otherwise, she might have to simply watch all of the movies, taking notes whenever a lightsaber appears.

## Background
It is easy to find related documents such as captions, scripts, and summaries available online on sites like opensubtitles.org, dailyscript, and wikipedia. Each contains unique information useful for searching and browsing. The captions contain transcribed dialog while the script (used to plan the movie) has draft dialog with character names, along with locations, visual descriptions, and actions. Finally, the plot summary has high level events (e.g. "fell in love") and character traits (e.g. "menacing").

## System
SceneSkim automatically aligns these documents to each other and to the original movie in order to let users search and browse in movies using text.
