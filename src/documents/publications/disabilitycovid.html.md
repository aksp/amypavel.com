thumbnailalt: "Screenshot of a tweet by @CDCgov from April 1, 2020 3:55pm: Actions to reduce spread of the virus, such as social distancing, are key to #FlattenTheCurve. 2 of 3 (original tweet link: https://twitter.com/CDCgov/status/1245439600472084486) The tweet contains an image of the common public health infographic about “flattening the curve”, but the tweet did not include alt text for the image. The image shows an example of a common flatten the curve info-graphic. A tall peak indicates the height of the pandemic if left unchecked, and a shorter spread out curve depicts the effects of social distancing efforts."
